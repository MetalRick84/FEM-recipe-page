### Useful resources

- [bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Kevin Powell Youtube-playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjNDRHoXGort7sDWcna8cGPA)

I did not use bootstrap to build this but I copied concepts from this framework.

From the Kevin Powell Playlist the first three videos also gave me some hints how to implement some things.
